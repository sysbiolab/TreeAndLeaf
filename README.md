### *TreeAndLeaf*: Displaying binary trees with focus on dendrogram leaves
The TreeAndLeaf package combines tree and force-directed layout algorithms for drawing binary trees, aiming to represent multiple layers of information onto the leaves.

### Installation
TreeAndLeaf is availble from the Bioconductor repository:

```{r}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("TreeAndLeaf")
```
